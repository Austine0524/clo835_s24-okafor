# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.6 or higher.
- You have a basic understanding of Python projects and virtual environments.

## Installation

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

To avoid conflicts with other Python projects you may be working on, it's a good idea to use a virtual environment. Here's how you can set one up:

**For macOS and Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**For Windows:**

```cmd
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To start the server, run:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible as configured in your Python script.

## Using the Application

To interact with the application, you can use the following `curl` command to create a new item in the database:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/items \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"id": "4", "name": "maziar"}'
```
