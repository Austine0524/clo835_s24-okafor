Project Title
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed Python 3.6 or higher.
You have a basic understanding of Python projects and virtual environments.
Installation
Setting up a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other Python projects you may be working on, it's a good idea to use a virtual environment. Here's how you can set one up:

For macOS and Linux:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
For Windows:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Installing Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
To start the server, run:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible as configured in your Python script.

Using the Application
To interact with the application, you can use the following curl command to create a new item in the database:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/items \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"id": "4", "name": "maziar"}'
